## Introduction

Noya is a new kind of design tool that offers the best of both low-fidelity
wireframes and high fidelity designs.

## Interacting with the Noya tool

- Creating and editing blocks
- Configuring blocks with #commands
- Special elements (/write, /icon, /image)
- Show menu options

- Idea: let people try blocks in docs, then copy/paste into their own projects
