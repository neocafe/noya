title: How it Works

## Why Noya?

Thereâ€™s always a tricky tradeoff between working in low-fidelity wireframes vs.
high-fidelity mockups when working on a product idea. Working in low-fidelity
allows for quick iteration while hammering out the big picture, but people often
have a hard time imagining the final product.

Because of this, teams frequently jump to high-fidelity and stop using
wireframes too early, which slows down progress dramatically as they spend an
excessive amount of time perfecting unimportant details.

## A better way to wireframe

Noya is a new kind of design tool that provides the advantages of both
low-fidelity and high-fidelity design.

With Noya, you build your project with wireframes, while the tool automatically
generates a high-fidelity output in real time. It works by mapping low-fidelity
blocks into high-fidelity design system and React components.

## Current limitations

Noya is a work-in-progress! A few limitations (and popular feature requests)
are:

- Noya is currently _1-screen-per-project_. If you want to create multiple
  screens, you can do so by creating multiple projects. The easiest way to
  create a new screen may be by duplicating the project.
- Styling and customizing blocks - styling and customization options are
  currently limited and inconsistent across blocks.
- The code that Noya outputs is not production-quality yet - it will still
  require a developer to customize the code to improve the layout and plug in
  real data.
