## Choosing a base design system

Noya currently supports a single base design system,
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). We chose Chakra for its simplicity and ease
of use in React code. We plan to add first-class support for more open source
design systems in the future, including:

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
